Hi, I'm Nathan Frank,

I'm interested in all kinds of data analysis.

I'm currently working on sports statistics tracking to see what trends appear, how accurate they are, and they mean for future contests.

If you have any questions or want to contact me about anything else, my email address is nathanf49@gmail.com
